## Pomodoro Twitch Extension

### Overlay Extension
Typescript react extension for showing pomodoro statuses and allowing updates of pomodoro statuses.

### Workers
We'll probably use Cloudflare Workers for our remote API calls. These allow us to write javascrpt/typescript function code that is executed server side and can make CRUD calls to our database.
